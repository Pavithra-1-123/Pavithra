    <h2>About</h2>
    <P> I'm K.Pavithra, a passionate and curious college student currently pursuing my degree in Information Technology. I'm all about exploring the world of tech—from coding and software development to cybersecurity and everything in between.

      I love solving problems, building things that make life easier, and constantly learning new skills. Whether it's a cool side project, a new programming language, or understanding how systems work behind the scenes, I'm always up for a challenge.
      
      Right now, I’m focused on sharpening my skills in web development, databases, and networking.</P>
